This project is a customized chatbot developed for SAP LABS INDIA during my internship period. The chatbot is implemented using React as front-end. The davinci model of chatgpt is finetuned for this purpose using the JSON-L pairs. These pairs are obtained by scraping the content of the SAP LABS using BEAUTIFUL SOUP library, then preprocessing and summarizing using BART TRANSFORMERS library. The chatbot is called SARA and answers questions specifically for SAP LABS INDIA.
